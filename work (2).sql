Probably in another universe! However, having a formal sales cycle can help you increase your revenue generation rate by 18 percent.\r\n\r\nDo bear in mind that every organization follows some basic sales cycle stages to close deals regardless of their industry. And, we have further simplified the process just for you. For, this blog is all about sharing a clear and consistent approach for nurturing leads.\r\n\r\nSo, let’s start with the basics before getting into the stages of the sales cycle!', '1. Prospecting  \r\nProspecting is the first stage of the 7 stages of the sales cycle. You may be looking at your target customer profiles at this point, selecting possible clients to contact, and deciding how to approach them. Create an Ideal Customer Profile first (ICP). Your ICP will be, at its most basic level, a fictional organization that: \r\n\r\nRepresents companies that both provide you high value in terms of revenue, influence.\r\nYou provide excellent value, usually in terms of ROI, and improved service.\r\nYou can start constructing a database and list all the potential prospects that suit that profile after building an ICP. You’ll need to create a list of prospective leads and qualified leads for your sales reps once you’ve identified the right companies.\r\n\r\nYou must qualify your prospects even if you’re working with the best ICP. Try looking for the following:\r\n\r\nNeed\r\nBudget\r\nAuthority\r\nNeed at the Right Time\r\nThen, based on your specific needs, check at additional factors like company size, growth, geography, etc. While you may have to meet your lead in-person to qualify them fully, your preliminary inquiry should indicate their qualities.\r\n\r\n2. Making Contact \r\nNow that you found them, it’s time to contact and build a relationship with your prospective client.\r\n\r\nChoosing the Best Approach – Email is an excellent channel to communicate with your lead directly and personalize your outreach. Try sending them between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m and from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. because people are usually not busy and might also check their emails to wind up their work in the evening. cold calling is another tried and tested option that works well. You also have social media, and the way you use social media is highly dependent on the platform and your target audience. Combine it with email marketing to boost your chances of connecting with the lead. It would be a good idea to use multiple channels for outreach. \r\nExecution – Before you reach out, know what you want to accomplish. Use the outreach to establish and introduce yourself, earn trust and finally start a conversation. \r\n3. Qualifying Your Prospect \r\nBy qualifying your lead, you can learn more about your target prospect. When making decisions, try to understand their sales goals, challenges, budget, and other important factors. It’s also critical to confirm that you’re engaging with the proper decision-maker.\r\n\r\nIt is also a chance to qualify them as prospects and verify that they meet the primary criteria. Don’t be discouraged if you discover they aren’t a good match. It’s pretty unusual for less than 50% of your initial options to be a good fit. The most straightforward approach to determining if a prospect is a right fit is to speak with them directly.\r\n\r\n4. Nurturing Your Prospect \r\nPrepare to answer essential questions regarding your unique offers and what pain points you can solve for them. Nurture your leads based on what you learned. Lead nurturing includes educating leads about your product, service, and industry, personalizing your message, and resolving common issues. Here you attempt to build a reputation as a helpful, responsive, and dependable resource in your field of expertise.\r\n\r\nYou’ll almost certainly run across interested and generally qualified prospects but aren’t ready to sign up right now for whatever reason. In such a situation, it’s critical to keep in touch periodically and provide assistance to stay top of mind. You’ll be the first person on their mind when they’re ready to buy.\r\n\r\n5. Presenting Your Offer \r\nSo far, the cycle is prospect-centric. You’ve reached out to them, learned about their needs, and addressed their concerns. It’s time to start putting all you’ve learned to good use and present the best offer possible.\r\n\r\nMaintain your offer’s relevancy, targeting, and customization concerning the needs you discussed before. Make your proposal relevant to their problems, budget, and long-term objectives. Finally, think about how you can present and market your offer.\r\n\r\n6. Overcoming Objections \r\nTypically, prospects will object to your offer. Price vs. value, risk, contract terms, and other issues are some of the most typical sales objections. It’s best to address these issues as quickly as possible, ideally during the nurturing stage. However, dealing with them in advance is not always viable. When reacting, be patient and empathize with their difficulties. Rushing or pressurizing won’t help in any way.\r\n\r\nAfter you’ve clarified everything, request them to affirm that you have resolved their concerns and make sure that your lead understands your offer.\r\n\r\nOne piece of advice to get to the root of any issue is that you’ll always have to ask more questions. After you pose a question, try to pay attention to their response rather than thinking about what you’ll say next. You can proceed to the final stage when you address all the objections.\r\n\r\n7. Closing the Sale \r\nOnce you’ve done a fantastic job, complete the sales cycle by closing the deal.\r\n\r\nIf the prospect’s profile matches your ICP, you’ve reached out in a way they prefer, and you’ve provided value, they should be willing to buy. You should never feel compelled to use deception to persuade them to buy, but even the most ideal prospect may need a nudge before deciding. You can’t count on them to close on their own. The objective is to make it very simple and approachable for them to understand and say yes.\r\n\r\nClosing the sale also lays the groundwork for the next steps. You can now request a start date or give them an additional bonus if they sign today. Avoid giving discounts, even if it seems contradictory. Closing is also a good time to remind them of a specific result you think you can deliver for their company. Feel free to use your imagination in any way you like. You can also try the following:\r\n\r\nArouse a sense of urgency\r\nProvide financial incentives\r\nOffer free trial\r\nStick around after you’ve closed the deal and received their commitment to answer any remaining probing sales questions and give them clear subsequent actions. If you’re having a face-to-face meeting, offer to send them and their assistant or superior a summary email that summarizes your discussion and agreement.\r\n\r\nFollow up – Finally, despite your best efforts, things beyond your control may result in the response being ‘No’. In this case, adding them to a nurture campaign and following up with any prospects who aren’t ready to say yes regularly is the best thing you can do. You could also use this opportunity to connect with others in the organization.', 'What Is A Sales Cycle?\r\nA sales cycle is a series of steps that you must follow to obtain new customers. It is divided into several phases that correlate to the sales funnel phases and describe a task that the salespeople must complete before bringing the sale to completion. Each of the sales cycle stages serves a specific purpose.\r\n\r\nIt’s a potential client’s journey from identifying the need for a service or a product to making a purchase. The sales process acts as a blueprint for the sales reps. It’s a step-by-step process that a salesperson follows to convert a prospect into a long-term customer. Both B2B and B2C organizations use the terms sales cycle and sales process interchangeably.\r\n\r\nA sales cycle encompasses much more than a sales script. It includes everything a salesperson does before contacting a prospect, during the nurturing period, and after closing the sale. It also specifies triggers for when your prospect has progressed from one level to another. The most excellent method to make your sales more consistent, unify your entire team’s efforts, and scale-up is to have that structure in place.\r\n\r\nWhy Is A Sales Cycle Important?\r\nSales cycle & its importance \r\nBusinesses can gain insight into the productivity of their sales activities by using a structured sales cycle. By identifying and analyzing the stages at a detailed level, you can understand what worked and what didn’t. Defining a comprehensive cycle in your organization is critical for the following reasons :\r\n\r\nIt helps you know where your current prospect is in the sales cycle, their needs, and how to meet them.\r\nIt helps eliminate bottlenecks and strengthens the sales processes. With clearly defined sales stages, it’s easy to spot when and where something isn’t quite right.\r\nIt’s easier to onboard and train new sales representatives. While training new reps, it’s simple to explain what happens at each stage and where problems may arise.\r\nYou can analyze the success of your sales team and recognize great players thanks to the transparency of the sales cycle.\r\nA buyer-centric cycle aids in understanding your target audience better and delivering the most pertinent information.\r\nYou can structure your team more effectively if you understand your sales cycle deeper. For example, if you look at your cycle and discover a bottleneck, you can re-assign duties to your team to ensure that enough is getting done at that particular stage.\r\nThe length of these procedures can be tracked, investigated, and compared to the industry standard length. If your cycle is shorter than the industry average, it could indicate that your sales force is more productive than your competitors.\r\nThe detailed information from your sales process can aid in forecasting future sales. For example, based on the average length of your sales cycle, you may use the data to determine how many sales each salesperson can make in a month and which sales are most likely to succeed once they reach a given point in the buyer’s journey. You can also use SalesBlink’s Free Sales Commission Calculator to calculate how much revenue you’ll generate upon every sale.\r\nHow Is The Sales Cycle Different From Sales Funnel And Sales Process?\r\nThe sales cycle is how you identify, qualify, contact, negotiate, close the deal, follow up, and build a client relationship. However, the sales funnel is the same process but for viewing in-process deals. It contains a list of all active sales projects resulting from contacts with prospects and clients.\r\n\r\nThe sales process usually refers to the repeatable actions your sales team performs to get prospects to move from an early stage to the final stage of closing the deal.\r\n\r\nHow To Create A Sales Cycle?\r\nYour company utilizes a series of procedures to generate leads and close sales. Your sales pipeline and funnel should be aligned with your company’s specific sales process, offering a blueprint for your sales staff to follow. Review your sales funnel, turn pipeline stage activities into stages, visualize your sales process, and establish a system to track each step to create an effective sales process.\r\n\r\nIt would help if you considered the following when building a sales cycle:\r\n\r\nYour service or product\r\nYour buyer’s profile\r\nThe number of people who make decisions\r\nThe merchandise’s cost\r\nPrerequisites for your product.\r\nSelling a B2B product requires many decision-makers, high-value deals, and a lengthier sales cycle than selling a consumer product. Because of the general lower deal value and the smaller number of decision-makers involved, the cycle for consumer items is typically shorter. While most sales cycles have a set of logical phases in common, you must tailor them based on the product and prospect type in either scenario.', '2022-06-03 06:13:09'),
(3, 'work/s.jpg', 'Hot Leads: How To Generate & Convert Them Effectively?', '61% marketers consider generating leads the toughest job on the face of this planet. And, they’re right in a way. Nevertheless, it is also directly proportional to the growth of any business. This means, you can’t ignore it either. So what do you do? The simplest answer to this would be: you prioritize your focus on the Hot Leads! \r\n\r\nGiven the fact that hot leads are the easiest to convert when compared to cold and warm leads, it won’t be a daunting task for you after all! Especially when you have us with you! \r\n\r\nWe have already seen how to deal with converting cold leads and warm leads effectively. So, logically it is now time to know about hot leads.', 'What Is A Hot Lead? \r\nHot leads are the qualified leads ready to make a purchase. They have a high interest in your offering, so it is easy to convert them. The characteristics of these leads include the following:\r\n\r\nThey have the budget and decision-making authority.\r\nThey provide reps with a clear-cut timeline for closing the deal.\r\nThey know how your product or service can resolve the problem they are facing.\r\nThese leads are in the final stage of the sales process, i.e. closing. As a salesperson, it is better to get in touch with them as soon as possible as they may not want to delay closing the deal. \r\n\r\nWhat Is The Difference Between Hot And Warm Leads?\r\nAs you have seen, the main difference between warm and hot leads is the willingness to purchase. Warm leads fit into your ideal customer profile and get in touch with your business. On the contrary, a hot lead is a qualified lead that is one step ahead of warm leads that your sales team has nurtured. Understanding the difference between the two is essential as you have to approach them differently. \r\n\r\nBenefits Of Targeting Hot Leads\r\nThe main benefit of targeting hot leads is that they are the ones with the highest conversion rates. They may not be as many cold and warm leads, but they have the highest chance of closing a sale. And that is ultimately what you want as a salesperson, don’t you?\r\n\r\nHow Does Selling To Hot Leads Feel Like?\r\nSelling to hot leads is quite easy when compared to selling to cold or warm leads. When you have a hot sales lead with you, all you need to do is contact them and seal the deal. You don’t have to nurture the lead with several meetings to take them to the grand finale. Your job is to remove the little obstacles in the path and put your best foot forward to turn the lead into a patron.\r\n\r\nThe fact that categorizing a lead as hot is the fruit of your previous hard work in the different phases of the sales cycle. \r\n\r\nHot Leads & Qualified Leads: Do they differ?\r\nDo you know that there is something that you have to focus more on than classifying leads as cold, warm, and hot? It is the need to qualify leads.\r\n\r\nA qualified lead refers to one who fits your ideal customer’s mold. You must qualify your lead at the beginning of the sales cycle because it is pointless to invest your resources in someone who doesn’t need your solution in the first place!\r\n\r\nNow the question is whether hot and qualified leads are the same or not? Well, the blunt answer is that they are not! Qualified leads can include cold, warm, and hot leads. Just because a sales lead is hot doesn’t mean that it is qualified.\r\n\r\nIt boils down to one thing – A ‘qualified lead’ is one that is a perfect fit for your ICP.\r\n\r\nHow To Identify And Market To Hot Leads?\r\nYou would always want hot leads in your sales pipeline, don’t you? That is because they are willing to buy your product or service immediately if you handle them well. The probability of a hot lead converting into a customer is very high. \r\n\r\nDespite the high likelihood of closing the deal, you have to use specific marketing strategies,', '1. Keep them in the know\r\nKeep hot leads in the know\r\nWhen you add new features to a product or service, it’s better to let the leads know about it to make an immediate purchase from you.\r\n\r\n2. Promote your product or service\r\nPromote to hot leads\r\nAs hot leads know about you, you can emphasize your brand in the marketing content you create. They are likely to share it with their network. \r\n\r\n3. Be nice to them\r\nBe nice to hot leads\r\nWhen you treat hot leads as special individuals, they will become loyal customers. It is better to give them special discounts and offers even after that. In short, maintain a special relationship with such leads. ', '2022-06-03 06:13:09'),

After you pose a question, try to pay attention to their response rather than thinking about what you’ll say next. You can proceed to the final stage when you address all the objections.\r\n\r\n7. Closing the Sale \r\nOnce you’ve done a fantastic job, complete the sales cycle by closing the deal.\r\n\r\nIf the prospect’s profile matches your ICP, you’ve reached out in a way they prefer, and you’ve provided value, they should be willing to buy. You should never feel compelled to use deception to persuade them to buy, but even the most ideal prospect may need a nudge before deciding. You can’t count on them to close on their own. The objective is to make it very simple and approachable for them to understand and say yes.\r\n\r\nClosing the sale also lays the groundwork for the next steps. You can now request a start date or give them an additional bonus if they sign today. Avoid giving discounts, even if it seems contradictory. Closing is also a good time to remind them of a specific result you think you can deliver for their company. Feel free to use your imagination in any way you like. You can also try the following:\r\n\r\nArouse a sense of urgency\r\nProvide financial incentives\r\nOffer free trial\r\nStick around after you’ve closed the deal and received their commitment to answer any remaining probing sales questions and give them clear subsequent actions. If you’re having a face-to-face meeting, offer to send them and their assistant or superior a summary email that summarizes your discussion and agreement.\r\n\r\nFollow up – Finally, despite your best efforts, things beyond your control may result in the response being ‘No’. In this case, adding them to a nurture campaign and following up with any prospects who aren’t ready to say yes regularly is the best thing you can do. You could also use this opportunity to connect with others in the organization.', 'What Is A Sales Cycle?\r\nA sales cycle is a series of steps that you must follow to obtain new customers. It is divided into several phases that correlate to the sales funnel phases and describe a task that the salespeople must complete before bringing the sale to completion. Each of the sales cycle stages serves a specific purpose.\r\n\r\nIt’s a potential client’s journey from identifying the need for a service or a product to making a purchase. The sales process acts as a blueprint for the sales reps. It’s a step-by-step process that a salesperson follows to convert a prospect into a long-term customer. Both B2B and B2C organizations use the terms sales cycle and sales process interchangeably.\r\n\r\nA sales cycle encompasses much more than a sales script. It includes everything a salesperson does before contacting a prospect, during the nurturing period, and after closing the sale. It also specifies triggers for when your prospect has progressed from one level to another. The most excellent method to make your sales more consistent, unify your entire team’s efforts, and scale-up is to have that structure in place.\r\n\r\nWhy Is A Sales Cycle Important?\r\nSales cycle & its importance \r\nBusinesses can gain insight into the productivity of their sales activities by using a structured sales cycle. By identifying and analyzing the stages at a detailed level, you can understand what worked and what didn’t. Defining a comprehensive cycle in your organization is critical for the following reasons :\r\n\r\nIt helps you know where your current prospect is in the sales cycle, their needs, and how to meet them.\r\nIt helps eliminate bottlenecks and strengthens the sales processes. With clearly defined sales stages, it’s easy to spot when and where something isn’t quite right.\r\nIt’s easier to onboard and train new sales representatives. While training new reps, it’s simple to explain what happens at each stage and where problems may arise.\r\nYou can analyze the success of your sales team and recognize great players thanks to the transparency of the sales cycle.\r\nA buyer-centric cycle aids in understanding your target audience better and delivering the most pertinent information.\r\nYou can structure your team more effectively if you understand your sales cycle deeper. For example, if you look at your cycle and discover a bottleneck, you can re-assign duties to your team to ensure that enough is getting done at that particular stage.\r\nThe length of these procedures can be tracked, investigated, and compared to the industry standard length. If your cycle is shorter than the industry average, it could indicate that your sales force is more productive than your competitors.\r\nThe detailed information from your sales process can aid in forecasting future sales. For example, based on the average length of your sales cycle, you may use the data to determine how many sales each salesperson can make in a month and which sales are most likely to succeed once they reach a given point in the buyer’s journey. You can also use SalesBlink’s Free Sales Commission Calculator to calculate how much revenue you’ll generate upon every sale.\r\nHow Is The Sales Cycle Different From Sales Funnel And Sales Process?\r\nThe sales cycle is how you identify, qualify, contact, negotiate, close the deal, follow up, and build a client relationship. However, the sales funnel is the same process but for viewing in-process deals. It contains a list of all active sales projects resulting from contacts with prospects and clients.\r\n\r\nThe sales process usually refers to the repeatable actions your sales team performs to get prospects to move from an early stage to the final stage of closing the deal.\r\n\r\nHow To Create A Sales Cycle?\r\nYour company utilizes a series of procedures to generate leads and close sales. Your sales pipeline and funnel should be aligned with your company’s specific sales process, offering a blueprint for your sales staff to follow. Review your sales funnel, turn pipeline stage activities into stages, visualize your sales process, and establish a system to track each step to create an effective sales process.\r\n\r\nIt would help if you considered the following when building a sales cycle:\r\n\r\nYour service or product\r\nYour buyer’s profile\r\nThe number of people who make decisions\r\nThe merchandise’s cost\r\nPrerequisites for your product.\r\nSelling a B2B product requires many decision-makers, high-value deals, and a lengthier sales cycle than selling a consumer product. Because of the general lower deal value and the smaller number of decision-makers involved, the cycle for consumer items is typically shorter. While most sales cycles have a set of logical phases in common, you must tailor them based on the product and prospect type in either scenario.', '2022-06-03 06:13:09'),
(6, 'work/s.jpg', 'Hot Leads: How To Generate & Convert Them Effectively?', '61% marketers consider generating leads the toughest job on the face of this planet. And, they’re right in a way. Nevertheless, it is also directly proportional to the growth of any business. This means, you can’t ignore it either. So what do you do? The simplest answer to this would be: you prioritize your focus on the Hot Leads! \r\n\r\nGiven the fact that hot leads are the easiest to convert when compared to cold and warm leads, it won’t be a daunting task for you after all! Especially when you have us with you! \r\n\r\nWe have already seen how to deal with converting cold leads and warm leads effectively. So, logically it is now time to know about hot leads.', 'What Is A Hot Lead? \r\nHot leads are the qualified leads ready to make a purchase. They have a high interest in your offering, so it is easy to convert them. The characteristics of these leads include the following:\r\n\r\nThey have the budget and decision-making authority.\r\nThey provide reps with a clear-cut timeline for closing the deal.\r\nThey know how your product or service can resolve the problem they are facing.\r\nThese leads are in the final stage of the sales process, i.e. closing. As a salesperson, it is better to get in touch with them as soon as possible as they may not want to delay closing the deal. \r\n\r\nWhat Is The Difference Between Hot And Warm Leads?\r\nAs you have seen, the main difference between warm and hot leads is the willingness to purchase. Warm leads fit into your ideal customer profile and get in touch with your business. On the contrary, a hot lead is a qualified lead that is one step ahead of warm leads that your sales team has nurtured. Understanding the difference between the two is essential as you have to approach them differently. \r\n\r\nBenefits Of Targeting Hot Leads\r\nThe main benefit of targeting hot leads is that they are the ones with the highest conversion rates. They may not be as many cold and warm leads, but they have the highest chance of closing a sale. And that is ultimately what you want as a salesperson, don’t you?\r\n\r\nHow Does Selling To Hot Leads Feel Like?\r\nSelling to hot leads is quite easy when compared to selling to cold or warm leads. When you have a hot sales lead with you, all you need to do is contact them and seal the deal. You don’t have to nurture the lead with several meetings to take them to the grand finale. Your job is to remove the little obstacles in the path and put your best foot forward to turn the lead into a patron.\r\n\r\nThe fact that categorizing a lead as hot is the fruit of your previous hard work in the different phases of the sales cycle. \r\n\r\nHot Leads & Qualified Leads: Do they differ?\r\nDo you know that there is something that you have to focus more on than classifying leads as cold, warm, and hot? It is the need to qualify leads.\r\n\r\nA qualified lead refers to one who fits your ideal customer’s mold. You must qualify your lead at the beginning of the sales cycle because it is pointless to invest your resources in someone who doesn’t need your solution in the first place!\r\n\r\nNow the question is whether hot and qualified leads are the same or not? Well, the blunt answer is that they are not! Qualified leads can include cold, warm, and hot leads. Just because a sales lead is hot doesn’t mean that it is qualified.\r\n\r\nIt boils down to one thing – A ‘qualified lead’ is one that is a perfect fit for your ICP.\r\n\r\nHow To Identify And Market To Hot Leads?\r\nYou would always want hot leads in your sales pipeline, don’t you? That is because they are willing to buy your product or service immediately if you handle them well. The probability of a hot lead converting into a customer is very high. \r\n\r\nDespite the high likelihood of closing the deal, you have to use specific marketing strategies,', '1. Keep them in the know\r\nKeep hot leads in the know\r\nWhen you add new features to a product or service, it’s better to let the leads know about it to make an immediate purchase from you.\r\n\r\n2. Promote your product or service\r\nPromote to hot leads\r\nAs hot leads know about you, you can emphasize your brand in the marketing content you create. They are likely to share it with their network. \r\n\r\n3. Be nice to them\r\nBe nice to hot leads\r\nWhen you treat hot leads as special individuals, they will become loyal customers. It is better to give them special discounts and offers even after that. In short, maintain a special relationship with such leads. ', '2022-06-03 06:13:09'),
(7, 'upload/qw.jpg', 'Top 24 Strategies To Improve Sales Performance', 'Do you know that sales reps spend only 39% of their time selling? Surprising, right? The remaining 61% of the time goes into searching for prospects and validating the data collected. As a result, there is a negative impact on their productivity. It is quite obvious that this contradicts the aim of businesses which is to improve sales performance.  In short, the urge for more sales is universal and we are sure that you are also in the same league!  Nevertheless, increasing sales productivity can be quite a task in itself and most businesses struggle with it. One of our clients, Bob, was facing similar issues. But he managed to increase his conversions by 45% by following the strategies we outlined. Don’t be jealous, we’ll share the same with you!   However, before moving on to the nitty gritty of improving sales performance, let’s dig deep into sales performance, the factors that affect it and how to measure it…', 'Key Pillars Of Sales Performance With so many roadblocks in the path of a productive sales team, a few essential pillars act as the foundational building blocks for increasing sales productivity. These play a significant role in improving sales performance.  1. Consistency You need a solid organizational sales framework for consistency. Although each salesperson may have their own style, you should implement the exact sales process strategy.   2. Concentration The amount of distractions that pull us away from our everyday objectives seems to be increasing. Therefore, try to remove the distractions from your current focus or set aside time in your daily routine to complete those activities.  3. Constant Improvement Keeping what’s working isn’t inherently negative, but it stifles progress. Because the field sales business is evolving at such a rapid pace, salespeople’s productivity suffers due to their refusal to adapt.  4. Reduce Pressure The competitive and fast pacing nature of the field sales environment puts additional pressure on sales reps to succeed and meet their quotas. Rethink your sales quotas to make sure they’re ambitious but achievable. Salespeople who believe quotas are tough to meet are less likely to try since they believe they will fail regardless of their efforts.', 'What Is Sales Performance? Sales performance is the process of measuring sales activity and comparing the results to sales targets and quotas. On the whole, every business wants good sales performance, yet it can be challenging to accomplish for many.    Consistency is the key to effective sales results. Anyone can have a successful sales month, but a high-performing sales team can consistently meet or exceed sales goals over time, regardless of economic conditions or competition. Overall, improvisation in efficiency is figuring out ways to use time efficiently. One can keep the end objective in mind by including structure and purpose in their day.   What Factors Affect Sales Performance? Your enablement activities, such as content management or sales training, affect your sales effectiveness, customer experience, cross-functional alignment, and corporate culture. These aspects work together to assess whether your team has the skills and knowledge they need to engage clients successfully.  Let’s take a look at the internal factors:  Recruitment standards Company culture Sales staff training Availability of automation and technology  Quality of the product Customer experience Capital availability Supply chain Let’s now move to the external factors that can influence sales performance:  The political or economic climate Competition Laws and regulations Fluctuating consumer preferences  Technology innovations', '2022-06-03 08:46:16');
